## Why?

That's a good question.

## Rant

Okay so [this compiler](https://github.com/dogescript/dogescript) is garbanzo.
I could have written a better compiler for this godawful language with my eyes
tied behind my back. It's just so bad at conforming to the spec. I litereally
tried to compile some of their examples and they didn't work. I expect
enterprise quality dogescript compilers given it's age.
